# PDF Q&A ChatBot

### A conversational AI powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that answers questions about your documents.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project is a full-stack, AI-driven application designed to allow users to ask natural language questions about their PDF documents and receive accurate, context-aware answers. It solves the problem of needing to manually search through large files for specific information.

The core of the application is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline, which intelligently combines document retrieval with a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide grounded and reliable responses.
